# EcoliGenomic

This R package can be used in order to type (using E coli MLST scheme) and screen (e.g. for the presence of virulence) E coli genomes. Both functions can be applied on genomes that can be either complete or draft (i.e., WGS in multiple contigs). To this end, both main functions are 'typemlst' and 'screen_Blast'.
